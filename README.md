# Travel Route Optimizer 🗺️

A web application that finds the shortest and cheapest travel routes between cities using Dijkstra's Algorithm.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This application helps travelers find optimal routes by calculating:
- **Shortest path** by distance
- **Cheapest path** by cost

Built with modern software engineering practices including OOP principles, comprehensive testing, and clean architecture.

## 🚀 Features (In Development)

- [ ] Graph-based city and route management
- [ ] Dijkstra's algorithm implementation
- [ ] Web API for route calculations
- [ ] Interactive web interface
- [ ] Visual map representation
- [ ] Comprehensive unit tests

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

**Backend:**
- Python 3.8+
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Dijkstra's Algorithm
- PyTest for testing

**Frontend:** (Coming in Phase 3)
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript or React

## 📦 Installation
